this is where we will share our work. So now you have to do your homework.

When you make changes follow this mantra:
-commit
-pull
-push

You will commit changes you made. 
You will pull any new changes I may have pushed.
Then you will push your changes along with the changes you pulled so they are merged together.

I will do the same so that our code is in lock step.
